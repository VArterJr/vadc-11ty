**VinceArter.com has been my main, personal landing page for many years now.**

<a href="https://arter.us" target="_blank">Arter.US</a> is our family's personal landing page.

**History:** I've had this site running since ~1996 (in one form or the other). The site was originally called DaDen.com. Shortly after that, I succumbed to the trend to have my name as my domain. I sold DaDen.com a few years after that. I have many other domains, including: Arter.US, ArterFamily.com, Protoduction.com [Protoduction.com has now been sold as well], and a few others for specific projects.

**Purpose:** In the past, the site has been a sharing point for students who took technology and programming classes I taught at St. Louis County Community College. It has been a point for exchanging ideas with friends, colleagues, and community developers. It has been a place to share pictures and music I've written. It has been a place to share code I've developed (or am just playing around with). Currently it is more informational than cooperative sharing.

**Technology:** Over the years this site has been implemented using different approaches to its layout and code. Around mid-2022 I rebuilt the previous static HTML5/CSS/JavaScript site with a more dynamic implementation using Jekyll, Liquid Layout, and Markdown (I ❤️ Markdown). Markdown allows for the quick creation and editing of content without having to mess with HTML5 styling and markup.

Now, in 2025, I have gotten rid of all of the Jekyll and Liquid and moved to **11ty (Eleventy)** for dynamic rendering of Markdown. Jekyll was being finicky on upgrades (and sometimes took hours to fix post-upgrade) and 11ty is simpler, focused, and fully supports modern web development practices. I may eventually convert my legacy Medium blog to Markdown and put it here at some point... maybe.

**Other things you may see on the site:**

- Visual Art: Art I've created over the years and some interesting AI art projects I've done lately (primarily OS backgrounds / wallpapers).
- Music: Stuff I play around with in my home studio.
- Development: Ideas and projects I am working on.
- Thoughts: On my personal study of music, computer science, philosophy, religion, etc.
- And other things I haven't thought of yet.

**Thank you for stopping by, and please come back for more content in the coming months.**
